# Title: ROI Forecasts for Multi-Channel Marketing Strategies

Know how various target strategies will impact return on media investments   

## A beginning: Advertising and marketing executives must make multi-million dollar decisions on budget allocation 

Most times these decisions are based on scant data. What's more, predictions for revenue and ROI are typically calculated by 3rd party agencies managing a particular media channel (eg social, search, video) who don't have knowledge of multi-channel attribution. So, fragmentation and insufficient data leave these executives with little confidence and a lot of exposure to major media buys.


## A middle: Analytics stack that powers an "intelligence engine" which generates scenario based forecasts

Create a technology that can sit on or integrate with companies data warehouses/lakes/data bases, pipe data from advertising networks, CRM systems, analytics tracking, and other marketing data points to extract signals and model returns based on those signals 


## An end: Executives can make decisions more confidently and with greater positive impact on their organization
an unintended consequence might be that some analyst roles may be deemed unneccessary and could be removed; however, because media investments are optimized, there may be "free-up" funds that could be used to hire for more creative roles
