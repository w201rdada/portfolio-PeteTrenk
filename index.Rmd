### Abstract of my first cool idea: Predicting Advertiser Spend {-}

By using machine learning to predict how much a given advertiser could spend, Microsoft can distinguish an advertiser's actual budget from its potential budget and alert sales teams to how a particular advertiser is trending against their benchmark or [share of wallet opportunity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/share-of-wallet.asp). 

Internet Explorer/Edge Bing traffic log files for any given domain, web traffic stats from major search networks (which can be provided by 3rd parties) and a domain business vertical-classification algorithm will serve as core signals in the prediction model. The vertical classification algorithm will group the new advertiser with other like-advertisers. Web log data from the vertical cohort provides directional data on the amount of search demand for any given vertical. And traffic data from other publishers, like Google, help identify major variances in expected vs actual traffic.


### Abstract of my second cool idea: Objective Assessment of Surf Conditions with Computer Vision {-}

Leveraging advancements in computer vision and machine learning to improve the current forecast methodology for surfing and to develop an eye for good surf that out performs our own. Setting a pipeline between live camera feeds from major surf sites and a computer vision framework inclusive of parallax provides the analytics platform needed to run models that predict near real-time: wave speed, wave height, and time-on-wave. These metrics provide a much more objective assessment of surf conditions which should be favorable to both surfers and those judging surfers.
