## Dawn Patrol Blues

For those who work 9-5, catching surf usually means waking up at dawn. To sleep or not to sleep becomes the routine question. To help answer that, surfers can consult several websites that offer daily forecasts and wave condition rankings. Some even offer live video streams. Yet surfers are all too familiar with the scenario of a good forecast going bad or poor judgements based on live video, creating what's known as the dawn patrol blues - showing up to the beach with no surfable waves in sight. But advancements in computer vision and machine learning offer new hope to avoid these situations. Through the analysis of real-time surf cameras, we can improve the current forecast methodology and perhaps develop an eye for good surf that out performs our own.



## Computer Vision Goes Surfing

How waves are created and how they are different depend on wind, fetch, swell period, and the ocean floor (bathymetry). Each of these variables, themselves, can fluctuate quite a bit, making accurate predictions of wave quality for most surf spots challenging. Current datasets used to gather these variables include information from: the National Data Buoy Center, NOAA (nationa oceanic and atmosphere administration) for tide information and offshore storms, General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans, localized weather conditions from Weather Underground. All of these variables are currently modeled into a forecast of 5 categories of wave conditions across major surf forecast sites: poor, fair, poor to fair, fair to good, good. But what is actually used to define these categories is based on user feedback and, therefore, highly subjective. For a more objective assessment, a real-time readout out of wave speed, wave height, and predicted time-on-wave should be provided. This information can really only be provided by a near real-time analysis of wave videos. Setting up an pipeline between Surfline's wave cam feeds and a computer vision framework to run a custom prediction model can provide the most objective assessment of wave quality.

## Training on Real Waves.

Adding in wave speed, wave height, and predicted time-on-wave from the model could be used to train the independent variables modeled into surf forecasting and help fine-tune those models. The result should be forecasts with higher confidence intervals and a less biased status of wave conditions. In short, no more dawn patrol blues.
